I developed a Currency Converter React application where I delved into creating `custom hooks` to efficiently fetch data from a third-party `API`. These hooks were instrumental in retrieving real-time currency exchange rates, enabling seamless calculations within the app. Utilizing this data, I crafted `components` that ensured high reusability and modularity throughout the application. Ultimately, the app effortlessly converts currencies and displays the converted results on the webpage, showcasing the amalgamation of `custom hooks`, `API integration`, and `component reusability` in action.
